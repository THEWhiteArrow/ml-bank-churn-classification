## Project Description

This project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the churn of bank customers. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1/data).

## Observations

-   the data set includes less than 20 features so technically it is a small data set on which we can brute force all possible models
